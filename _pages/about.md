\[Geo\]Data is my professional portfolio, blog, and repository of self-made tutorials. Here, I will make connections between all things GIS and data, while focusing on these areas: (1) automation, (2) reproducibility, (3) software development and data engineering, (4) \[geospatial\] data science, and (5) business intelligence.


## Jordan Frey

I am a data engineer specializing in geospatial applications. I have fluency in Python, R, SQL, and git, and have experience implementing enterprise solutions in both an AWS and Azure cloud environment.

I obtained my Master's degree (2020) in Geographic Information Science from Clark University in Worcester, MA. I have a Certificate of Advanced Study (2018) in Data Science from Syracuse University, and obtained my Bachelor's degree (2015) in Environmental Studies from Ithaca College.
